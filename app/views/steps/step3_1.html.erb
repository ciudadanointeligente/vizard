                            <h4>Description</h4>
                            <p>As indicated in the UNICEF (2010) Advocacy Toolkit, in policy spheres particularly, decisions are often made according to a cycle or schedule. To maximise your policy influence you need to have a sound understanding of the policy processes. First, because last-minute interventions rarely work, and the earlier in the decision-making cycle the idea is accepted, the more effective the end result is likely to be. Second, because the analysis of the decision-making process helps to identify opportunities and entry points to begin influencing an issue. </p>
                            <p>The four phases of decision-making usually include:</p>
                            <ol type="a">
                              <li>agenda setting</li>
                              <li>formulation and enactment</li>
                              <li>implementation and enforcement,and </li>
                              <li>monitoring and evaluation.</li>
                            </ol>
                            <p>It is important to remember that decisions are often made through formal and informal processes so you should make sure that you are fully familiar with both.The information, jointly with the stakeholder analysis, will affect your strategy: what you will do and when, with who and who to target. For example, while in the agenda-setting phase you will focus on convincing the policymakers that the topic requires attention, in the formulation phase you will try to influence policymaker on your preferred option for action. </p>
                            <p>The processes differ among countries and policies. If you are working in promoting legislation or a legislation reform you need to have an in-depth understanding on how decisions are made at the Parliament. This will allow you to target specific moments (i.e. discussion in commission or plenary) or structures (i.e Parliamentary commissions) maximizing the impact or your efforts. At the global level the decision-making processes also vary significantly. The WTO negotiations differ from the negotiations on climate change or on the Sustainable Development Goals.</p>
                            <p>It is usually very useful to draw the decision-making process to help people visualize it. </p>

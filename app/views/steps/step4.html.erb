                                    <p>The interim outcomes are key changes that need to happen in order to achieve the advocacy objetive. They can be organized in a logical chain where the combined effort of reaching some of them contributes to achieve the overall objective. The deeper you have worked in your analysis of problems the more accurate you will be in organising your objectives.</p>
                                    <p>The interim outcomes usually refer to some of the following elements (see pg 64 of UNICEF toolkit)</p>

                                    <p>Social scientist have developed theories of change that can help you more effectively choose advocacy tactics and focus evaluation efforts on the most relevant outcomes. You can check which of those theories of change suits better your issue (see pg. 41 UNICEF advocacy toolkit) and the suggested related activities or you may create your own “theory of change” based on your experience and political intuition.</p>
                                    <p>You will describe how do you expect the change to happen and what will pave the way to the implementation of the policy solution that you have described above. Your theory of change explains the causal links between your actions and the intended impact.</p>

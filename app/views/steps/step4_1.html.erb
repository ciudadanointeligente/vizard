                            <p>The definition of the interim outcomes corresponds to the description of how you envision that the change will take place.</p>
                            <p>By this point in the planning process, the analysis to underpin an advocacy strategy is complete. The analysis must be pulled together and guide the definition of the shorter term results (interim outcomes) that must be achieved in order to reach the advocacy objective and the actions that will contribute to the interim outcomes (UNICEF (2010) Advocacy toolkit). Developing an advocacy strategy entails figuring out how to reach interim outcomes while keeping the long-term vision alive. </p>
                            <p>The interim outcomes usually refer to some of the following elements </p>

                            <p>As pointed out in the UNICEF (2010) Advocacy toolkit (pg.58), interim outcomes indicate movements towards the advocacy objective, they are “measures of effect” and therefore they “should also be worded in terms of the desire result or achievement not in terms of the activity or what will be done”.  “Raise support for children’s rights among key decision-makers,” for example, is activity-oriented. A results-oriented outcome is: “Decision-makers X, Y and Z will demonstrate their increased support for children’s rights by calling for increased funding for boys’ and girls’ primary education.”</p>
